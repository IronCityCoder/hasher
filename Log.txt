11:08AM Running into some issues setting up pytest on my VM. Py2/3 conflicts.

11:31AM Formula for determining file integirty: if st_mtime - st_atime > 0/ hashfile(before) == hashfile(after)

- fileStats.st_mtime & fileStats.st_atime

- Have a file of known hashes saved up, then run that file agaisnt all future passes to make sure everything is the same.

11:35AM Starting on recognizing hash input

2:31PM Added rstrip() to printer function to clean up newlines that are read in from files.

2:43PM Can no longer read csv file. Fixed.

3:42PM Can now parse in a list of hashes.

4:17PM -o mode filter isn't working.
